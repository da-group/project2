Histogram and Correlations
1. run python/python3 plot.py --hvar SHIFT LATITUDE LONGITUDE --bins 3 10 10 --qvar WARD DISTRICT NEIGHBORHOOD_CLUSTER
   From the histograms, we can see most of the crimes happened in evening and mid night. Longitude and Latitude crimes happened at are near to gaussian distribution.
   From the scatter plot, we can see the three attributes are relatively highly correlated. This indicates that these 3 types of area dividing are following the same order.

Hypothesis Testing
1. run python/python3 stat.py -m ttest --attr SHIFT LONGITUDE --div 1 2
   First, we can see distribution of longitude in day time and evening is near to gaussian distribution
   The null hypothesis is that crimes happened in day time and evening has little difference H0：μ0 = μ1
   The alternative hypothesis is that crimes happened in day time and evening has significant difference H1：μ0 ≠ μ1
   The output of p value is around 5.88e-10, therefore reject the null hypothesis in support of the alternative hypothesis
2. run python/python3 stat.py -m logis --lab SHIFT
   The hypothesis is that we can predict time crimes happened by other attributes related to area.
   We use the logistic regression to test this hypothesis.
   The output is 
   accuracy is 0.444789214637278
   confusion matrix is
   [[ 982 2274  174]
    [ 888 2847  297]
    [ 446 1110  328]]
    We can see the hypothesis can not be proved. Area is not directly related to crime time.
